{"name":"Opengapps","tagline":"Main repository for opengapps","body":"Getting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nTo get started with building Open GApps, you'll need to get the git sources:\r\n\r\nTo initialize your local repository using the Open GApps trees, use a command like:\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:opengapps/opengapps.git\r\n```\r\nThen sync the submodules to get the original APK sources as provided by Google.\r\nYou can also use this command to update at a later moment the sources to the most recent version\r\n```\r\n./download_sources.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build Open GApps for all platforms and all android releases:\r\n```\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nTo build Open GApps for a specific android release on a specific platform,\r\ndefine both the platform and the API level of that release, seperated by a dash.\r\nA (most widely used) example:\r\n```\r\nmake arm-22\r\n```\r\nOne can update the sources used with the command:\r\n```\r\n./add_sourceapp.sh /path/to/the/file/you/want/to/add.apk [/even/more/files.apk...]\r\n```\r\nBe careful! If add_sourceapp finds multiple architectures in the native code, it expects it to be a 'universal' package. This not always true with 64-bit packages though!\r\nFor contributors, updated sources can be uploaded by browsing to one of the sources-subdirectories and pushing it to the repository:\r\n```\r\ncd sources/architecture\r\ngit add *\r\ngit commit\r\ngit push\r\n```","google":"UA-63785067-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
